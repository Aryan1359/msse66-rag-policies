# AI Use Statement

This project leveraged several AI-powered tools and workflows throughout its development:

## Main AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT-5 (OpenAI):**
  - Served as the primary AI assistant, project manager, and prompt generator.
  - Used for architectural planning, code generation, debugging, documentation, and design decisions.
  - Provided guidance and best practices for modular RAG pipeline design, evaluation, and deployment.

- **GitHub Copilot (AI agent):**
  - Used within GitHub Codespaces for in-editor code completion, refactoring, and boilerplate generation.
  - Assisted with Python, Flask, and Jinja2 code, as well as documentation and configuration files.

## Development Environment

- **GitHub Codespaces:**
  - The entire project was developed inside GitHub Codespaces (cloud-based VS Code environment), rather than a local VS Code installation.
  - This provided a reproducible, cloud-based dev environment and seamless integration with Copilot and GitHub Actions.

## Summary

AI tools (ChatGPT-5 and Copilot) were integral to:
- Project planning and architecture
- Code and documentation generation
- Debugging and refactoring
- Improving productivity and code quality
