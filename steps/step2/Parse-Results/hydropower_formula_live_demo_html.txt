How to talk about it in your presentation


P
 (power) grows when either the drop is taller (
h
 increases) or more water moves each second (
Q
 increases). The constant terms ρ (water density) and g (gravity) turn height into energy, and η captures real‑world losses in the turbine/generator. Together: 
P = η·ρ·g·Q·h
.




Use the sliders live while presenting to show how doubling 
Q
 doubles power, or how raising 
h
 boosts power linearly.


Open “Advanced” to explain why we typically fix ρ≈1000 kg/m³ and g≈9.81 m/s².


Quote the “Power per (m³/s)” number to make quick mental math: each extra m³/s of flow adds that many Watts at your chosen head and η.
