The constant terms ρ (water density) and g (gravity) turn height into energy, and η captures real‐world losses in the turbine/generator. Together: P = η·ρ·g·Q·h . Use the sliders live while presenting to show how doubling Q doubles power, or how raising h boosts power linearly. Open “Advanced” to explain why we typically fix ρ≈1000 kg/m3 and g≈9.81 m/s2. Quote the “Power per (m3/s)” number to make quick mental math: each extra m3/s of flow adds that many Watts at your chosen head and η."}
