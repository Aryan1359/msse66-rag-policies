This era, known for its dynamic social changes and technological advances, also marked the birth of a new approach to design. As we explore the origins and evolution of design thinking, we'll uncover its deep-rooted connection to solving complex, multifaceted issues known as \"wicked problems\", with a special focus on the contributions of UC Berkeley in shaping this narrative. By the end of this video, you should be able to define design science and explain its significance in the evolution of design thinking, describe the characteristics of \"wicked problems\", and articulate why these problems defy traditional problem-solving methods. After the Industrial Revolution and World War II, the world underwent major shifts. Art, societal changes, technology, human and environmental needs, even philosophical questions all made it clear that we were facing increasingly complex problems. Initially emerging in the 1950s and 1960s within architecture and engineering, the concept of design thinking as it was then struggled to adapt to the era's rapid changes. The scope and scale and complexity of strategic thinking needed in World War II fundamentally changed the way we approach management, production, and industrial design in the modern world. In the 1960s, attempts to apply scientific methods to design aimed at making it a rigorous discipline. Around this time, Herbert Simon introduced the world to \"design science\". Simon was a pioneering figure in numerous fields, including artificial intelligence, psychology, computer science, and management science, known for his profound contributions to understanding of human decision-making processes and problem-solving. Simon proposed design not just as an art but as a systematic, scientific discipline. This groundbreaking idea, detailed in The Sciences of the Artificial, suggested that design could solve not only just practical problems, but also abstract, complex challenges by creating innovative solutions. This concept laid the foundation for design thinking, emphasizing a structured, methodical approach to uncovering and solving problems. The 1970s saw Herb Simon and others further conceptualize design as a way of thinking, emphasizing rapid prototyping and testing, laying down principles that are central to design thinking today. This era also marked advancements in artificial intelligence and its implications for design. The 1980s recognized solution-focused problem-solving, with Nigel Cross and Brian Lawson comparing the problem-solving approaches of designers and scientists, highlighting designers' preference for generating multiple solutions, known as satisficing behavior. Nigel Cross, now Emeritus Professor of Design Studies at The Open University in the UK, thoroughly examined what makes design its own special field of study. In 1982, Cross wrote a collection of papers called Designerly Ways of Knowing. These papers are foundational in the history of design. I encourage you to read them to learn more. One important takeaway from this work was that when it comes down to it, design isn't just about making things look good, it's really about problem-solving, and thinking, in a way that's different from how scientists or scholars tackle problems. It's like design has its own language and tools for solving puzzles that you won't find in other fields. As Cross describes it, \"A central feature of design activity, then, is its reliance on generating fairly quickly a satisfactory solution, rather than on any prolonged analysis of the problem. It is a process of 'satisficing', rather than optimizing, producing any one of what might well be a large range of satisfactory solutions, rather than attempting to generate the one hypothetically optimum solution. This strategy has been observed in other studies of design behavior, including architects, urban designers, and engineers\". This thread of research continued and was expanded by many. Brian Lawson, a professor from the University of Sheffield, was responsible for some fascinating experiments comparing how architecture students, or designers, and science students differed in their approach to solving problems. Lawson had designers arrange three-dimensional colored blocks following certain known and unknown rules, the most interesting takeaway being the following. While the scientists took a step-by-step approach to figure out the rules, designers were all about trying out different solutions until they identified one that worked. This demonstrated that designers are more likely to seek a workable solution right away, rather than dissecting the"}

This demonstrated that designers are more likely to seek a workable solution right away, rather than dissecting the problem bit by bit. As Lawson described it, scientists were problem-focused problem solvers, compared to designers, who were solution-focused problem solvers. This important distinction further encouraged others to study how a repeatable process for solving problems was a hallmark of design thinking. One important contribution came from Peter Rowe's 1987 book, Design Thinking, in which he further explored the design process, specifically in architectural contexts, contributing to the broader understanding of design thinking. As he describes it, it was, quote, \"an attempt to fashion a generalized portrait of design thinking.\" From the 1990s to present, design thinking has been popularized by organizations such as IDEO and many academic institutions across the world. Universities such as Berkeley, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon, among many others, began making repeatable design methodologies more accessible and widely adopted across various fields. Part of the appeal is a standard toolkit for addressing some of the most difficult and pressing societal challenges, or \"wicked problems\". The ability of design to address our most challenging problems has always been an important thread throughout the history of design. While historically, this concept has often been referred to as \"wicked problems\", you may also be familiar with the term \"complex sociotechnical systems\" that many people prefer to use today. Now let's examine a bit about the history of \"wicked problems\". I personally love this history because of its deep connection to UC Berkeley. The term \"wicked problems\" was actually believed to be coined by design theorist Professor Horst Rittel at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, introducing a new dimension to the challenges design thinking aimed to address. \"Wicked problems\" demand that we think differently, collaborate more broadly, and remain flexible in our approaches. \"Wicked problems\" are characterized by their complexity, resistance to straightforward solutions, and lack of clear definitions. They are large-scale societal, environmental, and organizational challenges like climate change, healthcare, and urban planning, where the problem evolves even as solutions are attempted. Addressing \"wicked problems\" requires an adaptive, interdisciplinary approach focusing on understanding the human element at their core. Let's define \"wicked problems\" broadly. They have no definitive formulation. Solutions are not true or false, but better or worse. Every \"wicked problem\" is essentially unique and novel, and there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error. UC Berkeley's environment has fostered a profound and deep exploration of \"wicked problems\", led by Rittle's early investigations. The university became a place where the concept of collaborative, interdisciplinary problem-solving was nurtured. This approach to education and research emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives and collective brainstorming in crafting innovative solutions to complex issues, a history that we try to uphold today. As we conclude our brief exploration of design thinking's history and its crucial role in solving \"wicked problems\", we're reminded of the power of human-centered design. It's a mindset that looks beyond the surface, diving into the complex web of human needs and societal challenges, armed with empathy, creativity, and the collaborative spirit. The journey from the 1960s to today shows us that design thinking is not just about creating. It's about understanding, adapting, and innovating in the face of uncertainty. As we continue to face new challenges, the principles of design thinking remind us that every problem, no matter how wicked, holds the potential for innovative solutions."}
