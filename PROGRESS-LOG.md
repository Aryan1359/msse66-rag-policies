## âœ… Phase 1 â€” Environment & CI Setup

**2025-10-12 â†’ Step 1â€“7**

| Step | Action                                                  | Result                       |
| :--: | :------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
|   1  | Created public repo + Codespaces                        | reproducible cloud dev setup |
|   2  | Virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`)            | isolated deps                |
|   3  | Pinned Python 3.12.1 (`.python-version`, `runtime.txt`) | consistent runtime           |
|   4  | Added minimal deps (`Flask`, `python-dotenv`)           | base framework               |
|   5  | Minimal Flask app (`/`, `/health`)                      | returns `{status:ok}`        |
|   6  | Branch â†’ PR â†’ merge workflow                            | clean main history           |
|   7  | CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)                | smoke-import test green âœ…    |

---

## âœ… Phase 2 â€” Ingestion & Keyword Retrieval

* Implemented `scripts/ingest.py`, `scripts/chunk.py`, and `scripts/index_jsonl.py`.
* Added sample markdown policies under `data/policies/`.
* `/search` endpoint returns keyword matches with `mode`, `query`, `topk`, `results[]`.
* CI + local verification complete.

---

## âœ… Phase 3 â€” Embeddings & Vector Search

* Added `scripts/embed_index.py` + `scripts/vector_search.py` (NumPy cosine).
* Extended `/search` to support `mode=vector`.
* Added `sources[]` array for compact citation info.
* Seeded small evaluation QA set in `data/eval/`.
* CI smoke tests green.

---

## âœ… Phase 4 â€” UI & Answer Formatting (2025-10-21)

* Homepage UI redesigned for clarity and organization
* Indexed Files now shown in a table with delete icons
* Ask a Question box displays answer first, sources below
* All changes deployed and live on Render

---

## âœ… Phase 4 â€” RAG Answer Synthesis

**2025-10-20**

* **Step 1:** Created `feat/phase4-llm-setup` branch â€” scaffolded `scripts/llm_client.py` with safe fallback, CI-ready.
* **Step 2:** Added `scripts/generate_answer.py` (retrieval â†’ prompt â†’ LLM), fallback, CLI test, docs.

  ```bash
  python -m scripts.generate_answer --q "PTO accrual policy?" --topk 3
  ```
* **Step 3:** Implemented `/ask` endpoint (POST + GET) wrapping generator, returning `answer`, `sources`, `source_labels`, timing fields.

  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"question":"How do holidays accrue?","topk":4}' | jq
  ```
* **Step 4:** Citation polish `[S#]` â†” `source_labels` mapping validated.

  ```python
  def test_citations_map():
      import app, json
      c = app.app.test_client()
      r = c.post("/ask", json={"question":"PTO accrual policy?","topk":3})
      assert r.status_code == 200
      data = r.get_json()
      k = len(data["sources"])
      assert list(data["source_labels"].keys()) == [f"S{i}" for i in range(1, k+1)]
  ```

## âœ… Phase 5 â€” Evaluation Thresholds & CI Gate

**2025-10-21**

* Created `scripts/eval_ask.py` â€” computes groundedness, citation rate, p95 latency without NumPy.
* Added Makefile target `eval-gate` with thresholds + artifact outputs.
* Expanded QA set to â‰ˆ 15 diverse policy questions.
* CI gate fails (exit 2) if any metric below thresholds.
* Workflow `.github/workflows/eval.yml` uploads artifacts + enforces gate.
* Verified locally: 100 % grounded/cited, p95 â‰ˆ 8 ms < 4 000 ms âœ…
* Merged PR #17 â†’ tagged **v0.6.0**.

---

## âœ… Phase 6 â€” Deployment Scaffold (Render)

**2025-10-21 â†’ v0.7.0â€“v0.7.1**

* Added `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt`.
* Added `Procfile` (`web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT}`).
* Added `render/render.yaml` (free plan, health /health).
* Verified local gunicorn run + CI green.
* Deployed to **Render** successfully â†’ [https://msse66-rag-policies.onrender.com](https://msse66-rag-policies.onrender.com) âœ…
* Live Demo: [https://msse66-rag-policies.onrender.com](https://msse66-rag-policies.onrender.com)
* Updated README with **Live Demo** section.
* Merged PR #19 â†’ tagged **v0.7.1**.

---

## âœ… Phase 7 â€” Modularization, Logging, and Metrics (2025-10-22 to 2025-10-24)

* Refactored app into modular blueprints: each pipeline step (upload, parse, chunk, embed, search, ask, evaluate) is a separate module and UI page.
* Implemented robust, persistent logging for all user questions, answers, citations, and latency (step7/logs/ask.jsonl, step6/logs/search.jsonl).
* Added metrics dashboard (Step 8): grounded rate, citation correctness, latency, recent questions, and evaluation summary.
* Improved citation extraction and latency logging for accurate metrics.
* UI/UX improvements: navigation bar fixes, homepage redesign with Lottie animation, footer enhancements, better spacing.
* Provider and chunking method selection in Step 7 UI.
* API key management in UI for OpenRouter, Groq, OpenAI.
* Persistent log and data file handling for Render deployment.
* Merged feature branches, resolved conflicts, and cleaned up old branches.
* Rewrote and updated README (structure, usage, deployment, API, evaluation).
* Added deployed.md with live demo link as required.
* All changes tested and validated in production.
